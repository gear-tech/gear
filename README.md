# ‚öôÔ∏è What does Gear do?

<p align="center">
<img src="images/rust.png" height="64"><br>Gear provides the easiest and most cost-effective way <br>to run WebAssembly programs (smart-contracts) compiled from <br>many popular languages, such as Rust, C/C++ and more.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/api.png" height="64"><br>Gear ensures very minimal, intuitive, and sufficient API <br>for running both newly written and existing programs <br>on multiple networks without the need to rewrite them.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/state.png" height="64"><br>Smart Contracts are stored in the blockchain‚Äôs state <br>and are invoked preserving their state upon request.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/apps.png" height="64"><br>GEAR enables a seamless transition to Web3, <br>enabling the running of dApps, microservices, middleware and open APIs.
</p>

### :fire: Key features

 - Programs run in WASM WM (near-native code execution speed)
 - **Unique** :crown: : Parallelizable architecture (even greater speed)
 - **Unique** :crown: : Actor model for message-passing communications ‚Äî secure, effective, clear
 - dApp in minutes using GEAR libraries
 - Based on Substrate

### :bulb: Main capabilities

Gear enables anyone to create and run any custom-logic dApp and is a go-to solution for the following types of applications:
  - **Run dApps** that support business logic of any project in the **decentralized Gear network** (very fast). Upload programs to the network and interact with them.
  - Being a **Polkadot parachain**, Gear establishes cross-chain communications between other blockchains, allowing anyone to run a dApp in the Polkadot network in a very **cost-less** manner.
  - Join Substrate-supported blockchains in any other platform outside Polkadot.
  - A standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open API and more
  
  # üßê Why?

The blockchain technology launched a rapid transition from centralized, server-based internet (Web2) to decentralized, distributed one (Web3). 

Web3 introduces a new type of decentralized applications (dApps) that enable the existence of DeFi, DEX, Decentralized marketplaces, NFTs, Creators and Social Tokens.

Smart Contract is an equivalent of a microservice which is stored on the blockchain network and is the essential building block of a decentralized application.

Modern blockchains solve many issues of the older blockchain networks, such as:
 - Lack of scalability, low transaction speed, high transaction costs
 - Domain-specific development language (high barrier to entry)
 - Complex and inefficient native consensus protocols
 - Absence of intercommunication tools

But still have room for improvements due to:
 - Fixated, rigid native consensus protocols
 - Lack of interoperability with other networks

To resolve the interoperability issue, Parity technologies focused on creating a technology that connects every other blockchain: 
  - Polkadot - a blockchain of blockchains. Provides a ‚Äúrelay chain‚Äù (the primary blockchain) that enables ‚Äúparachains‚Äù (functional blockchains) to be deployed on top of it. All parachains are interconnected, creating a massive network of multifunctional blockchain services.
  - Substrate - a modular framework that allows to create custom-built blockchains with consensus mechanism, core functionality and security out of the box.

Building a blockchain with Substrate allows it to be deployed on any compatible relay chain such as Polkadot and Kusama
Substrate serves as a layer of communication between the relay chain and the parachain

# :factory: How does it work?

The internal flow of Gear:

  <img src="images/internal_flow.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%;">

Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-technical/blob/master/TECHNICAL.pdf">technical paper</a> for some insights about how Gear works internally.

# :books: Gear components

* [core](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/core) - Gear engine for distributed computing core components.

* [node](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/node) - Gear substrate-based node, ready for hacking :rocket:.

* [gstd](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/gstd) - Standard library for Gear smart contracts.

* [examples](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/examples) - Gear smart contract examples.


# :baby: Getting Started

1. To start familiarity with Gear, you can bring your own smart-contract program or take one from the [examples](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/examples). A comprehensive amount of smart contract examples are available for your convenience and faster onboarding.

2. Compile your smart-contract into WASM.

3. Deploy and test smart contract in Gear demo environment, send a message to a program, check how it is going. 

4. Also you can download and run your Gear node locally or create your own multi-node local testnet.

## :scroll: 1. Write and prepare your smart-contract

You can take your own program written in general purpose language (Rust is recommended) or use one of the provided [examples](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/examples).

## :wrench: 2. Compile smart-contract to WASM

Follow the instructions from [Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/get-started/getting-started-in-5-minutes) to compile the Rust to WebAssembly program.

## :runner: 3. Run you first smart contract
    
### Upload program from UI
    
1. Gear provides demo environment that emulates the real decentralized network, go to [https://idea.gear-tech.io](https://idea.gear-tech.io)

2. Choose the most convenient method to Sign-in to Gear - using Telegram or Github account

3. Create a Gear network account by clicking Add account in the top right corner:

 <img src="images/add-acc.png" alt="addAcc"><br>

4. Click **Upload program** and choose compiled .wasm file to upload
    1. Set enough Gas limit - 1 000 000
    2. Initial parameters, Initial value - keep default
    3. Upload file with Metadata, if applicable
        1. the file can be found after program compilation from available examples
    4. Click **Upload program**, wait for the program initialization

 <img src="images/upload.png" alt="Upload"><br>

5. Once your program is uploaded, head to the Recently uploaded programs section and find your program.

<img src="images/recent-progs.png" alt="recent-progs">

6. You can interact with your program via this action button: <img src="images/send-msg.png" alt="send-msg">

7. Deep dive to the [Smart Contracts section](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/get-started/smart-contracts/gear-program) of the GEAR Wiki for more details.

## :computer: 4. Run Gear Node  

Gear node can run in a single Dev Net mode or you can create a Multi-Node local testnet or make your own build of Gear node.

Refer to the [Gear Node README](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/node) for details and some examples.

1. Download nightly build of Gear node:

    - **Windows x64**: [gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip)
    - **macOS M1**: [gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz)
    - **macOS Intel x64**: [gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz)
    - **Linux x64**: [gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz](https://builds.gear.rs/gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz)

2. Run Gear node without special arguments to get a node connected to the testnet:

    ```bash
    gear-node
    ```

3. Get more info about usage details, flags, available options and subcommands:

    ```bash
    gear-node --help
    ```
