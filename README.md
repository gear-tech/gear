# Overview

Gear Protocol provides a developer-friendly programming platform for decentralized applications, along with custom runtime technology that can be used to deploy Layer-1 networks for running applications in a decentralized manner. The vision for Gear is to empower developers to create and deploy next-generation Web3.0 applications in the easiest and most efficient way possible.

## :fire: Key Features

- **Unique** :crown: : The main idea underpinning the Gear Protocol is the Actor model for message communications - secure, effective, clear.
- **Unique** :crown: : Parallelizable architecture ensures even greater speed.
- **Unique** :crown: : Continued messaging automation through delayed messages enables truly on-chain dApps.
- **Unique** :crown: : Gasless transactions through vouchers to leverage the dApps customer base and overall Web3 adoption.
- **Unique** :crown: : Built-in Actors to provide programs with enhanced access to pallets and to offload high-load computations off-chain.
- **Unique** :crown: : Create a dApp in minutes using Gear Protocol's libraries.
- Programs run in a Wasm VM, enabling near-native code execution speed.
- Based on Substrate, Gear Protocol ensures fork-less upgrades and compatibility with other blockchains.

## Capabilities

- Gear Protocol provides dApp developers with a very minimal, intuitive, and sufficient API for writing custom-logic programs in Rust and running them on Gear-powered networks, such as the Vara Network.
- It provides a technological foundation for constructing highly scalable and rapid decentralized Layer-1 networks.
- Reduces the computational burden on blockchains by offloading highly intensive calculations using a Vara node with WAVM, and then proving the correctness of these calculations on any blockchain.
- A Vara node can be used as a standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open API, and more.

For more details refer to the **[Gear Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.gear.foundation)**.

    1. Explore dApp examples in action and gain a deeper understanding of their functionalities. Write your own program or use one from the available templates. Adapt a template according to your business needs.
    2. [Test](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/developing-contracts/testing) your program off-chain and on-chain using a [local node](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/node/setting-up).
    3. Then upload it via Gear Idea to the [Vara Network](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs?node=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.vara.network).
3. :microscope: Dive into the documentation on Gear Protocol crates at https://docs.gear.rs.
4. :iphone: Implement a frontend application that interacts with your program using the [JS API](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-js/tree/main/api). React application examples are available [here](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/frontend/apps).

# Run Vara Node

### Get the binaries

To build Vara node binaries from source follow a step by step instructions provided in [Node README](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/node/README.md).

Alternatively, you can download pre-built packages for your OS/architecture:

  - **macOS M-series (ARM)**: [gear-nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz)
  - **macOS Intel x64**: [gear-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz)
  - **Linux x64**: [gear-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz)
  - **Windows x64**: [gear-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)


### Single-node Vara Dev network

Running the following command will start a single-node Vara Dev net with two users - Alice and Bob:

  ```bash
  gear --dev
  ```

By providing an additional argument one can specify the location of the chain database:
  
  ```bash
  gear --dev --base-path /tmp/vara
  ```
Now the dev node is listening on the [default] rpc port 9944: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944

To learn more about available CLI options and subcommands, run:

  ```bash
  gear --help
  ```

### Multi-node local Vara network

Running a local testnet with two validator nodes - Alice and Bob, allows to watch the multi-node consensus algorithm in action.
Note that if you launch both nodes on the same machine, you need to specify different ports for each node.

Start the `alice` node first:

  ```bash
  gear --alice --chain=local --base-path ./tmp/alice --port 30333 --rpc-port 9944 --validator
  ```

While the node is starting, inspect the start up log and look for the line that would look like the one below:

  ```bash
  2024-01-01 11:23:05 üè∑  Local node identity is: 12D3KooWMar4rG4kfoCZA1sqaY8FqtPDgpBPfDnQ7Md9x6Sdkgw5
  ```
Take note of the node identity string.

Now open another terminal window and start the `bob` node. Note that since both nodes are going to be running on the same machine we should choose different tcp and ws ports (for libp2p and rpc connections) for each node.
Also, we need to specify the `--bootnodes` parameter by providing the multiaddress of the `alice` node to let `bob` know where to look for its peer:

  ```bash
  gear \
    --bob \
    --chain=local \
    --base-path ./tmp/bob \
    --port 30334 \
    --rpc-port 9945 \
    --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWMar4rG4kfoCZA1sqaY8FqtPDgpBPfDnQ7Md9x6Sdkgw5
    --validator
  ```

Having done this, you should see the `bob` node connecting to the `alice` node and starting to produce blocks.

Check the network status at https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944.

### Connect to the Vara mainnet

Running a node that would sync with the Vara mainnet is as simple as running the following command:

  ```bash
  gear --chain=vara
  ```

As before, supplying a variety of CLI arguments allows to customize your node in terms of the chain database location, rpc port, and so on.

### Running an archive node

In some projects it can be useful to store all historical data. To run an archive node, use the following command:

  ```bash
  gear --chain=vara --blocks-pruning=archive --state-pruning=512
  ```
where the `--state-pruning` value specifies the history depth (in terms of the number of blocks) of the state to be kept in the database. All other CLI options apply, as usual.

Turning on the archiving option will significantly increase the disk space usage as well as impact the node's performance. This should be done judiciously.

### Connect to Vara testnet

Finally, calling simply
  
  ```bash
  gear
  ```
will connect you to the default chain, which is Vara testnet.

### Connect to a custom chain

To connect to a custom chain, the first thing one needs to do is to obtain the chain specification JSON file. Then calling the following command will start a node which will then try to connect to the bootnodes from the provided chain specification and start syncing blocks:

  ```bash
  gear --chain=/path/to/your/chain/spec.json
  ```
