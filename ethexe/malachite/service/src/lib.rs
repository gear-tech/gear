//! # Ethexe Malachite
//!
//! Ethexe-side wrapper around the application-agnostic
//! [`ethexe_malachite_core::MalachiteService`]. Stitches together:
//!
//! - the ethexe [`InjectedTxMempool`] (pulls user transactions into
//!   each producer's [`SequencerBlock`]),
//! - [`EthexeExternalities`] — the [`ethexe_malachite_core::Externalities`]
//!   implementation that builds new sequencer blocks, validates
//!   incoming proposals against ethexe's quarantine rules, and
//!   persists every saved/finalized MB into [`ethexe_db::Database`],
//! - [`MalachiteService`] — the public façade exposing the same API
//!   shape the rest of ethexe consumed before the migration to
//!   `ethexe-malachite-core`.
//!
//! ## Inputs
//! - [`Database`](ethexe_db::Database) — block storage and the
//!   parent-link source for the canonical-quarantine walks.
//! - [`MalachiteService::receive_new_chain_head`] — the latest
//!   Ethereum block from the observer event stream. Only the newest
//!   value is retained; it serves as the reference point for the
//!   producer's quarantine anchor.
//! - [`Mempool`] — sampled by the producer when assembling the next
//!   sequencer block; finalized injected transactions are flushed
//!   from it via [`Mempool::forget`] from the externalities.
//!
//! ## Outputs (`Stream<Item = Result<MalachiteEvent>>`)
//! - [`MalachiteEvent::BlockProposal`] — fires only after
//!   [`ethexe_malachite_core::Externalities::save_block`] has persisted the MB
//!   into the ethexe DB. ethexe-malachite-core's strict ordering guarantees that
//!   `save_block` runs ancestor-first, so the heights surfaced here
//!   are non-decreasing.
//! - [`MalachiteEvent::BlockFinalized`] — fires only after
//!   [`ethexe_malachite_core::Externalities::mark_block_as_finalized`] has run for
//!   `cert.block_hash`; same ancestor-first ordering.
