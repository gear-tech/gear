//! # Bucketed parallel program execution
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This approach speeds up the processing of multiple programs in parallel.
//! The main idea is to split programs into buckets based on their queue sizes or, in the future, another computation weight metric.
//!
//! Bucket processing helps reduce waiting time, as it minimizes the delay caused by the slowest message among all concurrently executed messages.
//! This works because, in sorted buckets, the computation time for each bucket element (queue messages) should be approximately equal.
//!
//! The second part of the approach is executing an entire program queue in one go within a single runtime instance.
//! This reduces overhead by minimizing calls within the WASM runtime.
//!
//! Due to this approach, we must handle journals deterministically in two stages:
//! - The first stage occurs in the runtime, where memory allocations, pages, and related resources are managed.
//! - The second stage is the native part, where the remaining journal entries are processed.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## How It Works:
//!
//! For example, we have program states with the following queue sizes,
//! where the "iter" column represents a computation step, and the "program" columns represent the queue sizes of each program:
//!
//! | iter | program 1 | program 2 | program 3 | ... | program N |
//! |-----:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----:|----------:|
//! |    0 |        10 |         1 |         5 | ... |         7 |
//! |    1 |         3 |         0 |         0 | ... |         0 |
//! |    2 |         3 |         1 |         1 | ... |         0 |
//! |    3 |         0 |         0 |         0 | ... |         0 |
//!
//! Before executing the programs, we need to split them into buckets.
//! The maximum bucket size is equal to the number of virtual threads.
//! The number of buckets is calculated as the total number of programs divided by the maximum bucket size.
//!
//! For example, given M buckets (virtual threads) and N program states, a sorted bucket structure will look like this:
//!
//! | bucket 0 | bucket 1 | bucket 2 | bucket 3 | ... | bucket M |
//! |---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----:|---------:|
//! |        9 |        7 |        4 |        3 | ... |        1 |
//! |        7 |        7 |        3 |        3 | ... |        1 |
//! |        8 |        6 |        4 |        3 | ... |        1 |
//! |       10 |        5 |        4 |        3 | ... |        1 |
//!
//! As you can see, the bucket contents are not strictly sorted, but this is not an issue.
//! We only need buckets with approximately equal queue sizes to ensure efficient parallel execution.
//! The entire queue is processed in a single runtime instance in one go, so prioritizing larger queues improves efficiency.
//!
//! Once all program queues have been processed, we deterministically merge journals and handle them.
//! After that, we repeat the process until no more messages remain
//! or we run out of processing time/gas allowance (to be implemented).
//!
//! **High-level overview of the algorithm:**
//!
//!   1. Split programs into buckets based on their queue sizes.
//!   2. Execute program queues in parallel using runtime instances per program.
//!   3. Merge journals and handle them deterministically.
//!   4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no messages are processed, or we run out of processing time/gas allowance.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Simplest Bucket Splitting Algorithm
//!
//! A basic bucket-splitting algorithm is implemented as follows:
//!
//!   1. First, calculate a temporary bucket index based on the program queue size.
//!   2. Next, store the required data in a temporary bucket list.
//!   3. Repeat this process for all programs.
//!   4. Since the number of elements in each temporary bucket is random, they need to be redistributed
//!      to ensure all final buckets contain an equal number of elements.
//!      To achieve this, we first merge all temporary bucket lists sequentially
//!      and then redistribute the data according to the expected bucket size.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Future Improvements
//!
//! Currently, the bucket partitioning algorithm is simple and does not consider a programâ€™s execution time.
//! In the future, we could introduce a weight multiplier to the queue size to improve partitioning efficiency.
//! This weight multiplier could be calculated based on program execution time statistics.
