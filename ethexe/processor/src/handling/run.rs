//! # Chunked parallel program execution
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The main idea is to split programs into chunks based on their queue sizes or, in the future, another computation weight metric.
//!
//! The *chunk* is defined as a subset of programs that are executed in parallel and grouped by their queue sizes.
//!
//! This approach should speed up the processing of multiple programs in parallel.
//! Processing in chunks helps reduce wasted CPU time, as it minimizes the delay caused by the slowest message among all concurrently executed messages.
//! This works because, in sorted chunks, the computation time for each chunk element (queue messages) should be approximately equal.
//!
//! The second part of the approach is executing an entire program queue (ideally) in one go within a single runtime instance.
//! This reduces overhead by minimizing calls within the WASM runtime.
//!
//! Due to this approach, we must handle journals deterministically in two stages:
//! - The first stage occurs in the runtime, where memory allocations, pages, and related resources are managed.
//! - The second stage is the native part, where the remaining journal entries are processed.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## How It Works:
//!
//! For example, we have program states with the following queue sizes,
//! where in parentheses we denote the queue size of each program and N is the total number of programs:
//!
//! |                          Programs                        |
//! |------------:|-----------:|-----------:|----:|-----------:|
//! |     P_1(10) |     P_5(2) |     P_9(5) | ... |   P_N-3(7) |
//! |     P_2(3)  |     P_6(1) |    P_10(1) | ... |   P_N-2(1) |
//! |     P_3(3)  |     P_7(2) |    P_11(1) | ... |   P_N-1(2) |
//! |     P_4(1)  |     P_8(1) |    P_12(2) | ... |     P_N(3) |
//!
//! Before executing the programs, we need to split them into chunks.
//! The maximum chunk size is equal to the number of *chunk processing threads*.
//! The number of chunks is calculated as the total number of programs divided by the maximum chunk size.
//!
//! For example, given N programs and M chunks, a sorted chunk structure will look like this:
//!
//! |     chunk 0 |    chunk 1 |    chunk 2 | ... |    chunk M |
//! |------------:|-----------:|-----------:|----:|-----------:|
//! |     P_1(10) |     P_2(3) |     P_N(3) | ... |    P_4(1)  |
//! |     P_6(5)  |     P_3(3) |    P_12(2) | ... |    P_8(1)  |
//! |     P_N-3(7)|     P_5(2) |    P_11(1) | ... |    P_10(1) |
//! |     P_9(5)  |     P_7(2) |   P_N-1(2) | ... |    P_N-2(1)|
//!
//! As you can see, the chunk contents are not strictly sorted, but this is not an issue.
//! We only need chunks with approximately equal queue sizes to ensure efficient parallel execution.
//!
//! Chunks are sorted in reverse order (descending), so the first chunk contains the largest queue size.
//! In hypothetic high-load scenarios, this measure may prevent (arguably) starvation of programs with large queue sizes.
//! Also as the entire queue is processed in a single runtime instance in one go, so prioritizing larger queues improves efficiency.
//!
//! Once all program queues have been processed, we deterministically merge journals and handle them.
//! After that, we repeat the process until no more messages remain
//! or we run out of processing time/gas allowance (to be implemented).
//!
//! **High-level overview of the algorithm:**
//!
//!   1. Split programs into chunks based on their queue sizes.
//!   2. Execute program queues in parallel using runtime instances per program.
//!   3. Merge journals and handle them deterministically.
//!   4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no messages are processed, or we run out of processing time/gas allowance.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Simplest Chunk Splitting Algorithm
//!
//! A basic chunk-splitting algorithm is implemented as follows:
//!
//!   1. First, calculate a temporary chunk index based on the program queue size.
//!   2. Next, store the required data in a temporary chunk list.
//!   3. Repeat this process for all programs with non-empty queues.
//!   4. Since the number of elements in each temporary chunk is random, they need to be redistributed
//!      to ensure all final chunks contain an equal number of elements.
//!      To achieve this, we first merge all temporary chunk lists sequentially
//!      and then redistribute the data according to the expected chunk size.
//!   5. Reverse the order of the chunks to ensure that the first chunk contains the largest queue size.
//!   6. Finally, we return the final chunk list.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Future Improvements
//!
//! Currently, the chunk partitioning algorithm is simple and does not consider a programâ€™s execution time.
//! In the future, we could introduce a weight multiplier to the queue size to improve partitioning efficiency.
//! This weight multiplier could be calculated based on program execution time statistics.
