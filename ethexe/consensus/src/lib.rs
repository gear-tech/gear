//! # Ethexe Consensus
//!
//! This crate provides controlling a behaviour of ethexe node depending on incoming blocks.
//!
//! The main components are:
//! - [`ConsensusService`]: A trait defining the core interface for consensus services
//! - [`ConsensusEvent`]: An enum representing various consensus events which have to be processed by outer services
//! - [`SimpleConnectService`]: A basic implementation of "connect-node"
//! - [`ValidatorService`]: Service for handling block validation
//!
//! The crate is organized into several modules:
//! - [`connect`]: Connection management functionality
//! - [`validator`]: Block validation services and implementations
//! - [`utils`]: Utility functions and shared data structures
