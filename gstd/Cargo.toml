#! ## Default features

default = ["panic-message"]

#! ## Panic handler profiles
#! We currently use the following format for panic messages from Rust code:
#! `panicked with '{message}'[ at '{location}']`. Also `Panic occurred: `
#! will be added to the beginning of the panic message by our core-backend.
#!
#! So the final panic message looks like this:
#! `Panic occurred: panicked with '{message}'[ at '{location}']`.
#!
#! You can configure which panic handler profile you need
#! by specifying one of the following functions:

## When enabled, a minimal panic handler is provided by this crate.
## Instead of a panic message, `<unknown>` is displayed.
panic-handler = ["const_format"]
## When enabled, a panic handler will also display a panic message.
panic-message = ["panic-handler", "arrayvec"]
## When enabled, a panic handler will also display a panic message and location.
## This function is not recommended for use in production environment
## because it displays the code path.
panic-location = ["panic-message"]

#! ## Nightly features
#!
#! The `panic-message` and `panic-location` features gets additional
#! optimizations when using the nightly compiler.
#!
#! For example, if you don't use the `panic-location` feature, the compiler
#! will remove all locations such as `/home/username/dapp/src/lib.rs:1:2`
#! from the binary. The size of program will be reduced and
#! `/home/username/...` information will not be included in the binary.

## Enables all features below.
## These features depend on unstable Rust API and require nightly toolchain.
nightly = ["panic-info-message", "oom-handler"]
## When enabled, a panic handler will use a more efficient implementation.
## Relies on [`panic_info_message`][rust-66745].
panic-info-message = []
## When enabled, an OOM error handler is provided.
## Relies on [`alloc_error_handler`][rust-51540],
oom-handler = []

#! ## Additional features

## Enables debug logging; this heavily impacts gas cost
## and is therefore disabled by default.
