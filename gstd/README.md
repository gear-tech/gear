# gstd

Standard library for Gear smart contracts. Provides necessary and sufficient functions and methods for your smart-contracts.

While `gcore` enables you to achieve the more low-level smart-contract implementation, `gstd` provides ready-to-use modules for your convenience and the implementation of smart-contracts in the most secure and accurate way, which is recommended in most cases.
