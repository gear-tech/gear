//! Messaging API for Gear programs.
//!
//! This module contains an API to process incoming messages and send outgoing
//! ones. Messages are the primary communication interface between actors (users
//! and programs).
//!
//! Every Gear program has code that handles messages. During message
//! processing, a program can send messages to other programs and users,
//! including a reply to the initial message.
//!
//! When some actor (user or program) sends a message to the program, it invokes
//! this program by executing the `handle` function. The invoked program can
//! obtain details of incoming messages by using this module's API ([`source`],
//! [`size`], [`load`], [`id`], [`value`], etc.).
//!
//! Optionally the program can send one or more messages to other actors. Also,
//! it can send a reply that differs from a regular message in two ways:
//! - There can be no more than one reply;
//! - It is impossible to choose the reply's destination, as it is always sent
//!   to the program invoker.
//!
//! Note that messages and a reply are not sent immediately but collected during
//! the program execution and enqueued after the execution successfully ends.
