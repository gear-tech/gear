//! Module with custom panic handlers implementations.
//! Introduces Gear's implementation of panic for memory allocation
//! and other common Rust panic.
//! Gear smart contracts run on Wasm, so the Rust program error is
//! considered equal to the Wasm runtime error `wasm32::unreachable`.
//! Panic handlers are available in two implementations -
//! debug and non-debug mode, for programs built in `wasm32` architecture.
//! For `debug` mode it provides more extensive logging.
