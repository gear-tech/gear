/// A reader-writer lock.
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`Mutex`](super::Mutex) does not distinguish between
/// readers or writers that acquire the lock, therefore blocking any actors
/// waiting for the lock to become available. An `RwLock` will allow any number
/// of readers to acquire the lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. The RAII
/// guards returned from the locking methods implement [`Deref`] (and
/// [`DerefMut`] for the `write` methods) to allow access to the content of the
/// lock.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The following program processes several messages. It locks the `RwLock` for
/// reading when processing one of the `get` commands and for writing in the
/// case of the `inc` command.
///
/// ```

///     // `some_address` can be obtained from the init payload
