/// A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data.

/// This mutex will block the execution waiting for the lock to become
/// available. The mutex can be created via a [`new`](Mutex::new) constructor.
/// Each mutex has a type parameter which represents the data that it is
/// protecting. The data can only be accessed through the RAII guard
/// [`MutexGuard`] returned from [`lock`](Mutex::lock),
/// which guarantees that data access only occurs when the mutex is
/// locked.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This example (program A), after locking the mutex, sends the `PING` message
/// to another program (program B) and waits for a reply. If any other program
/// (program C) tries to invoke program A, it will wait until program A receives
/// the `PONG` reply from program B and unlocks the mutex.
