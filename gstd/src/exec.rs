//! Sys calls related to the program execution flow.
//!
//! Wraps methods from `gcore` for getting the current block height,
//! the current block timestamp, the current value of the gas available for
//! execution.
//!
//!
//! The block height serves to identify a particular block.
//! This information can be used to enable many scenarios like restricting or
//! allowing of some functions until certain block height is reached.
//!
//! The timestamp is the number of milliseconds elapsed since the Unix epoch.
//!
//! Each message processing consumes gas, both on instructions execution and
//! memory allocations. This function returns a value of the gas available for
//! spending during current execution. Its use may help to avoid unexpected
//! behaviors during the smart-contract execution in case of not enough gas
//! available.
//!
//! Value available is the total available value of program.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use gstd::{exec, msg};
//!
//! // Send a reply after the block height reaches the number 1000
//! unsafe extern "C" fn handle() {
//!     if exec::block_height() >= 1000 {
//!         msg::reply(b"Block #1000 reached", 0).unwrap();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! ```
//! use gstd::{exec, msg};
//!
//! // Send a reply after the block timestamp reaches the February 22, 2022
//! unsafe extern "C" fn handle() {
//!     if exec::block_timestamp() >= 1645488000000 {
//!         msg::reply(b"The current block is generated after February 22, 2022", 0).unwrap();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! ```
//! use gstd::exec;
//!
//! // Perform work while `gas_available` is more than 1000
//! unsafe extern "C" fn handle() {
//!     while exec::gas_available() > 1000 {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! ```
//! use gstd::exec;

//! unsafe extern "C" fn handle() {
