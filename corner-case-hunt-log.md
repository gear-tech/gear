# Corner-case vulnerability hunt log

Branch: `gsobol/ethexe/corner-case-hunt` (off `gsobol/ethexe/malachite-new`).
Goal: find latent vulnerabilities / corner-case bugs in the ethexe-malachite
layer through targeted unit tests. Each iteration: invent one hypothesis,
write a test, run it. If the test PASSES (no bug reproduces) — delete the
test. If it FAILS (bug suspected) — verify the test is correct and KEEP it
(marked `#[ignore]`) as a bug record.

| 1 | 2026-05-21T08:55:00Z | validate_block_above lacks per-MB injected-tx size cap that build_block_above enforces — relies on 1MB Malachite hard cap (~8x looser than 127KB protocol cap) | ethexe/malachite/service/src/externalities.rs:557-560,584-590 | validate_rejects_mb_exceeding_injected_size_cap | abandoned | tmpfs /tmp full (6/7.5GB), rocksdb cc build OOM disk-quota. Couldn't compile to verify within budget. Hypothesis stands on code-reading: validator checks shape+quarantine+TxValidity+touched-cap but NOT cumulative `tx.encoded_size()` sum. Worth re-running with target on /home. |
