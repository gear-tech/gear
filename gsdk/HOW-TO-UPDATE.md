## Introduction to gsdk metadata

The [`gsdk`](.) crate contains [`src/metadata/generated.rs`](src/metadata/generated.rs) file generated by
the [`api-gen`](api-gen) crate. The generated code is used to submit extrinsics to a substrate node via RPC.

## Updating the generated code

You can do it with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/update-gsdk-metadata.sh
```

Otherwise, you can open the [`build.rs`](build.rs) file to learn how the code generation process works. In that case use
command `GSDK_API_GEN=1 cargo build --package gsdk --release` to start it. In case of any errors, follow the
instructions in the error message.
