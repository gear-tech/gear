## Introduction to gsdk metadata

The [`gsdk`](.) crate contains `vara_runtime.scala` file with SCALE metadata
used to submit extrinsics to a substrate node via RPC. It's generated by
the [`vara-runtime`](../runtime/vara) crate build script if `vara-runtime` crate
is built with `dev` feature.

## Updating the generated code

You can do it with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/update-gsdk-metadata.sh
```
or directly
```bash
cargo build -p vara-runtime --features dev
```
