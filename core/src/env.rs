/// Lock for the payload of the incoming/currently executing message.
///
/// The type was mainly introduced to establish type safety mechanics
/// for the read of the payload from externalities. To type's purposes
/// see [`Externalities::lock_payload`] docs.
///
/// ### Usage
/// This type gives access to some slice of the currently executing message
/// payload, but doesn't do it directly. It gives to the caller the [`PayloadSliceAccess`]
/// wrapper, which actually can return the slice of the payload. But this wrapper
/// is instantiated only inside the [`Self::drop_with`] method.
/// This is actually done to prevent a user of the type from locking payload of the
/// message, which actually moves it, and forgetting to unlock it back, because
/// if access to the slice buffer was granted directly from the holder, the type user
/// could have written the data to memory and then have dropped the holder. As a result
/// the executing message payload wouldn't have been returned. So [`PayloadSliceLock::drop_with`]
/// is a kind of scope-guard for the data and the [`PayloadSliceAccess`] is a data access guard.
///
/// For more usage info read [`Self::drop_with`] docs.
