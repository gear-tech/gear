//! Manager which handles results of message processing.
//!
//! Should be mentioned, that if message contains value we have a guarantee that it will be sent further in case of successful execution,
//! or sent back in case execution ends up with an error. This guarantee is reached by the following conditions:
//! 1. **Reserve/unreserve model for transferring values**.
//! Ownership over message value is moved not by simple transfer operation, which decreases **free** balance of sender. That is done by
//! reserving value before message is executed and repatriating reserved in favor of beneficiary in case of successful execution, or unreserving
//! in case of execution resulting in a trap. So, it gives us a guarantee that regardless of the result of message execution, there is **always some
//! value** to perform asset management, i.e move tokens further to the recipient or give back to sender. The guarantee is implemented by using
//! corresponding `pallet_balances` functions (`reserve`, `repatriate_reserved`, `unreserve` along with `transfer`) in `pallet_gear` extrinsics,
//! [`JournalHandler::send_dispatch`](core_processor::common::JournalHandler::send_dispatch) and
//! [`JournalHandler::send_value`](core_processor::common::JournalHandler::send_value) procedures.
//!
//! 2. **Balance sufficiency before adding message with value to the queue**.
//! Before message is added to the queue, sender's balance is checked for having adequate amount of assets to send desired value. For actors, who
//! can sign transactions, these checks are done in extrinsic calls. For programs these checks are done on core backend level during execution. In details,
//! when a message is executed, it has some context, which is set from the pallet level, and a part of the context data is program's actual balance (current balance +
//! value sent within the executing message). So if during execution of the original message some other messages were sent, message send call is followed
//! by program's balance checks. The check gives guarantee that value reservation call in
//! [`JournalHandler::send_dispatch`](core_processor::common::JournalHandler::send_dispatch) for program's messages won't fail, because there is always a
//! sufficient balance for the call.
//!
//! 3. **Messages's value management considers existential deposit rule**.
//! It means that before message with value is added to the queue, value is checked to be in the valid range - `{0} âˆª [existential_deposit; +inf)`. This is
//! crucial for programs. The check gives guarantee that if funds were moved to the program, the program will definitely have an account in `pallet_balances`
//! registry and will be able then to manage these funds. Without this check, program could receive funds, but won't be able to use them.
//!
//! Due to these 3 conditions implemented in `pallet_gear`, we have a guarantee that value management calls, performed by user or program, won't fail.
