//! This module contains pallet tests usually defined under "std" feature in the separate `tests` module.
//! The reason of moving them here is an ability to run these tests with different execution environments
//! (native or wasm, i.e. using wasmi or sandbox executors). When "std" is enabled we can run them on wasmi,
//! when it's not (only "runtime-benchmarks") - sandbox will be turned on.
