//! Lightweight library for use in Gear programs.
//!
//! This library should be used as a standard library when writing Gear
//! programs. Compared to [`gstd`](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/) crate, this
//! library provides lower-level primitives that allow you to develop less
//! expensive programs. Choose it if you are ready to write more code
//! but get a more efficient Wasm.
//!
//! Note that you are to define panic and out-of-memory handlers, as the crate
//! does not provide them by default.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//!
//! extern crate galloc;
//!
//! use gcore::msg;
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! extern "C" fn handle() {
//!     let mut bytes = [0; 64];
//!     msg::read(&mut bytes).expect("Unable to read");
//!     if let Ok(payload) = core::str::from_utf8(&bytes) {
//!         if payload == "PING" {
//!             msg::reply(b"PONG", 0).expect("Unable to reply");
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(target = "wasm32")]
//! #[panic_handler]
//! fn panic(_: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
//!     core::arch::wasm32::unreachable()
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
